# General repair instructions

1. Use fender seat and floor covers to keep the vehicle clean and prevent damage.
2. During disassembly, keep parts in the appropriate order to facilitate reassembly.
3. Observe the following:
    1. **CAUTION: Work must be started after approx. 20 seconds or longer from the time the ignition switch is turned to
       the `LOCK` position and the negative (`‚Äî`) terminal cable is disconnected from the battery (See page AB-2).**
    2. Before performing electrical work, disconnect the negative cable from the battery terminal.
    3. If it is necessary to disconnect the battery for inspection or repair, always disconnect the cable from the
       negative (`‚Äî`) terminal which is grounded to the vehicle body.
    4. To prevent damage to the battery terminal post, loosen the terminal nut and raise the cable straight up without
       twisting or prying it.
    5. Clean the battery terminal posts and cable terminals with a shop rag. Do not scrape them with a file or other
       abrasive object.
    6. Install the cable terminal to the battery post with the nut loose, and tighten the nut after installation. Do not
       use a hammer to tap the terminal onto the post.
    7. Be sure the cover for the positive (`+`) terminal is properly in place.

4. Check hose and wiring connectors to make sure that they are secure and correct.
5. Non-reusable parts
    1. Always replace cotter pins, gaskets, O-rings and oil seals etc. with new ones.
    2. Non-reusable parts are indicated in the component illustrations by the `üî∂` symbol.

6.  Precoated parts

    Precoated parts are bolts and nuts, etc. that are coated with a seal lock adhesive at the factory.

    1. If a precoated part is retightened, loosened or caused to move in any way, it must be recoated with the specified
       adhesive.
    2. Recoating of precoated parts
        1. Clean off the old adhesive from the bolt, nut or threads.
        2. Dry with compressed air.
        3. Apply the specified seal lock adhesive to the bolt or nut threads.
    3. Precoated parts are indicated in the component illustrations by the `‚≠êÔ∏è` symbol.

7. When necessary, use a sealer on gaskets to prevent leaks.
8. Carefully observe all specifications for bolt tightening torques. Always use a torque wrench.
9. Use of special service tools (SST) and special service materials (SSM) may be required, depending on the nature of
   the repair. Be sure to use SST and SSM where specified and follow the proper work procedure. A list of SST and SSM
   can be found at the back of this manual.
10. When replacing fuses, be sure the new fuse has the correct amperage rating. DO NOT exceed the rating or use one with
    a lower rating.

11. Care must be taken when jacking up and supporting the vehicle. Be sure to lift and support the vehicle at the proper
    locations (See page IN-12).
    1. If the vehicle is to be jacked up only at the front or rear end, be sure to block the wheels at the opposite end
       in order to ensure safety.
    2. After the vehicle is jacked up, be sure to support it on stands. It is extremely dangerous to do any work on a
       vehicle raised on a jack alone, even for a small job that can be finished quickly.

12. Observe the following precautions to avoid damage to
    the parts:
    1. **Do not open the cover or case of the ECU unless absolutely necessary.<br/>(If the IC terminals are touched, the
       IC may be destroyed by static electricity.)**
    2. To pull apart electrical connectors, pull on the connector itself, not the wires.

    3. Be careful not to drop electrical components, such as sensors or relays. If they are dropped on a hard floor they
       should be replaced and not reused.
    4. When checking continuity at the wire connector, insert the tester probe carefully to prevent terminals from
       bending.
    5. To disconnect vacuum hoses, pull on the end, not the middle of the hose.

    6. When steam cleaning an engine, protect the distributor, coil, air filter and VCV from water.
    7. Never use an impact wrench to remove or install temperature switches or temperature sensors.
    8. When using a vacuum gauge, never force the hose onto a connector that is too large. Use a step-down adapter
       instead. Once the hose has been stretched, it may leak.

13. Tag hoses before disconnecting them:
    1. When disconnecting vacuum hoses, use tags to identify how they should be reconnected.
    2. After completing a job, double check that the vacuum hoses are properly connected. A label under the hood shows
       the proper layout.
