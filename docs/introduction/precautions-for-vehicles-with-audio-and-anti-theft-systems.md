Audio Systems displaying the sign "ANTI-THEFT SYSTEM" shown on the left has a built-in anti-theft system which makes the audio system soundless if stolen.

If the power source for the audio system is cut even once, the anti-theft system operates so that even if the power source is reconnected, the audio system will not produce any sound unless the ID number selected by the customer is input again.
Accordingly, when performing repairs on vehicles equipped with this system, before disconnecting the battery terminals or removing the audio system the customer should be asked for the ID number so that the technician can input the ID number afterwards, or else a request made to the customer to input the
ID number.

For the method to input the ID number or cancel the anti-theft system, refer to the Owner's Manual.
