Always use a torque wrench.</li> <li>Use of special service tools (SST) and special service materials (SSM) may be required, depending on the nature of    the repair. Be sure to use SST and SSM where specified and follow the proper work procedure. A list of SST and SSM    can be found at the back of this manual.</li> <li> <p>When replacing fuses, be sure the new fuse has the correct amperage rating. DO NOT exceed the rating or use one with     a lower rating.</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>Care must be taken when jacking up and supporting the vehicle. Be sure to lift and support the vehicle at the proper     locations (See page IN-12).</p> <ol> <li>If the vehicle is to be jacked up only at the front or rear end, be sure to block the wheels at the opposite end    in order to ensure safety.</li> <li>After the vehicle is jacked up, be sure to support it on stands. It is extremely dangerous to do any work on a    vehicle raised on a jack alone, even for a small job that can be finished quickly.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Observe the following precautions to avoid damage to     the parts:</p> <ol> <li>Do not open the cover or case of the ECU unless absolutely necessary.(If the IC terminals are touched, the    IC may be destroyed by static electricity.)</li> <li> <p>To pull apart electrical connectors, pull on the connector itself, not the wires.</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>Be careful not to drop electrical components, such as sensors or relays. If they are dropped on a hard floor they    should be replaced and not reused.</p> </li> <li>When checking continuity at the wire connector, insert the tester probe carefully to prevent terminals from    bending.</li> <li> <p>To disconnect vacuum hoses, pull on the end, not the middle of the hose.</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>When steam cleaning an engine, protect the distributor, coil, air filter and VCV from water.</p> </li> <li>Never use an impact wrench to remove or install temperature switches or temperature sensors.</li> <li>When using a vacuum gauge, never force the hose onto a connector that is too large. Use a step-down adapter    instead. Once the hose has been stretched, it may leak.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Tag hoses before disconnecting them:</p> <ol> <li>When disconnecting vacuum hoses, use tags to identify how they should be reconnected.</li> <li>After completing a job, double check that the vacuum hoses are properly connected.

When troubleshooting the airbag system, always inspect the diagnostic    codes before disconnecting the battery (See page AB-24).</li> <li> <p>Work must be started after approx. 20 seconds or loner from the time the ignition switch is turned to the LOCK    position and the negative (<code>-</code>) terminal cable is disconnected from the battery. (The airbag system is equipped with a    back-up power source so that if work is started within 20 seconds of disconnecting the negative (<code>-</code>) terminal cable of    the battery, the airbag may be deployed.) When the negative (<code>-</code>) terminal cable is disconnected from the battery,    memory of the clock and audio systems will be cancelled. So before starting work, make a record of the contents    memorized by the audio memory system. Then when work is finished, reset the audio system as before and adjust the    clock. To avoid erasing the memory of each memory system, never use a back-up power supply from outside the vehicle.</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>Even in cases of a minor collision where the airbag does not deploy, the front airbag sensors and the steering wheel    pad should be inspected (See page AB-11).</p> </li> <li>Never use airbag parts from another vehicle. When replacing parts, replace them with new parts.</li> <li>Before repairs, remove the airbag sensors if shocks are likely to be applied to the sensors during repairs.</li> <li>The center airbag sensor assembly contains mercury. After performing replacement, do not destroy the oil part.
